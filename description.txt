This mod cycles ammunition for your currently held ranged weapon with the tap of a button.
It will only cycle ammunition that the weapon uses.

Compatible with other mods, probably.

v0.1.3:
* Cycling now skips to the next stack of ammo different from the currently used ammo
* Cycling now plays a sound to indicate ammo has changed

Future Plans:
* Ammo selection wheel
* Firing Patterns
